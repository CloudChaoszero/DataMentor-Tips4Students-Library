## Presentation Tips

### Personal tips:

1. If you are trying to execute non-interactive code while running a presentation, you're going to have a bad time--just have a *gif* of your performance, if you care about showing an audience you code

2. Don't be me--practice

3. visualizations or some type of interaction to gauge audience is nice, but not necessary

4. If you want to get technical, be prepared to state your results along with that.
